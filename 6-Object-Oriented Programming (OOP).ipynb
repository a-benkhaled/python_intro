    "# Small Project: Library Management System\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Create a simple library management system using object-oriented programming principles. The system should allow users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add new books to the library.\n",
    "2. Display the list of available books.\n",
    "3. Borrow a book.\n",
    "4. Return a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. Create a Book class with attributes such as _title_, _author_, _genre_, and _availability_ status.\n",
    "2. Implement methods in the Library class to add new books, display available books, borrow a book (if available), and return a book.\n",
    "3. Ensure that the system maintains a list of borrowed books and updates the availability status accordingly.\n",

    "# Create library object\n",
    "library = Library()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add new books to the library\n",
    "library.add_book(\"Book 1\", \"Author 1\", \"History\")\n",
